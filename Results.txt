Welcome to the image comparison program!
==========================================
1) Create Database from images in ./pictureDatabase/ folder
2) Load Database from file
 [DrJava Input Box]
System will now database all pictures in the "pictureDatabase" Directory.
Would you like a print out of the current files in the directory? (Y/N)

To create the database from the images it took:
Histogram=1751.706113457 seconds
CCV=1870.004888585 seconds
Correlogram=2045.694486335 seconds

Now saving all Histogram database results into a flatfile titled: Histogram.txt
Now saving all CCV database results into a flatfile titled: CCV.txt
Now saving all Correl database results into a flatfile titled: Correlogram.txt
To save the database flatfile it took:
Histogram=0.045578007 seconds
CCV=0.056535837 seconds
Correlogram=0.216196281 seconds
